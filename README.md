# pycalc
Simple calculator on python, written in academic purposes. It uses AST for executing, and support variables, constants, function calls, unary, etc.

# How to install?
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fakefloordiv/pycalc && cd pycalc
```

# How to run it?
```bash
$ python3 shell.py
```

This will run an interactive shell

Also you can put an expression as an argument of command line:
```bash
$ python3 shell.py -c "40+2"
42
```

# How to use it?
I personally allow you to use: integers, floats, constants, and functions. For example:
```
40 + rt(25, 5) - pi + 0.14
```
